I've been using emacs for a long time... But finally now I'm trying to switch to the modern editor, [Atom](https://atom.io/).

So far so good. There are good extension packages to simulate emacs operations, and I am very happy with the git, jekyll integration. Here are my installed package list at this moment.


- atom-beautify
- atomic-emacs
- autocomplete-plus
- autocomplete-snippet
- file-icons
- git-plus
- markdown-writer
- project-manager
- rails-transporter
- term2
- trailing-spaces

markdown-writer actually obsoleted [my previous post](http://en.goodpic.com/jekyll/2015/02/25/new-post-from-rake-file.html) ;)
